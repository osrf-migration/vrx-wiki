## Wavefield Modeling ##

These documents cover how the 3D wave surface is generated.

 * Wavefield Models: Description of the two models use for generating wavefields. Coming soon...
 * [Wavefield Implementation](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vrx/wiki/documentation/wavefield_generation): How the model is implemented to keep the visual and physical models in sync.
 * [Wavefield Envelope](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vrx/wiki/documentation/wavefield_envelope): Describes the ranges of wavefield parameters for VRX with examples of different seastates and how we measure consistency of the visual and physical models.
