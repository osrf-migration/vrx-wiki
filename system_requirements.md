# System Requirements for Running VMRC #

## Recommended system setup

### Hardware ###

In order to run VMRC we recommend your computing hardware has:

- Modern multi-core CPU, e.g. Intel Core i5
- 8 Gb of RAM
- Discrete Graphics Card, e.g. Nvidia GTX 650

The system will run wit out the GPU, but it the Gazebo simulation will run much faster with access to a GPU.

### Software ###

The VMRC software support is provided for the following software environment:

- Ubuntu Desktop 16.04 Xenial (64-bit)
- Gazebo 7.0.0 (<7.0.0 is not sufficient)
- ROS Kinetic

The system setup tutorials provides instructions for installing this environment directly on your host computer or by using a Docker container.

### Peripherals ###

We also recommend having a gamepad for testing when driving the WAM-V in the simulated world. In the examples we use a Logitech F310 ([walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Logitech-F310-GamePad/16419686)).
