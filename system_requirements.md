# System Requirements for Running VMRC #

## Recommended system setup
In order to run VMRC we recommend your computer has:

- Modern multi-core CPU, e.g. Intel Core i5
- 8 Gb of RAM
- Discrete Graphics Card, e.g. Nvidia GTX 650
- Ubuntu Desktop 16.04 Xenial (64-bit)
- Gazebo 7.0.0 (<7.0.0 is not sufficient)
- ROS Kinetic

The [system setup tutorial](http://bitbucket.org/osrf/vmrc/wiki/tutorials/SystemSetup) details the recommended process for installing Gazebo, ROS and VMRC.

We also recommend having a gamepad for testing when driving the WAM-V around in the simulated world. In the examples we use a Logitech F310 ([walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Logitech-F310-GamePad/16419686)).
