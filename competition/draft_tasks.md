# Draft Tasks #

This document is a preliminary description of the tasks and scoring currently envisioned for the 2019 VRMC.  We expect the final competition tasks to be similar to the proposals below, but they may be modified, replaced or removed for the actual competition.  The purpose of this draft is to provide teams with early guidance about the competition and solicit feedback on task design.

## Objective of VMRC ##

Rather than being an end in itself, the Virtual Maritime Robotics Competition (VMRC) is a means of supporting development for the physical RobotX event and raising the level of performance of all participants.  Consequently, the tasks and scoring should reflect this intent by emphasizing the foundational capabilities, and the thorough testing of these capabilities, which lead to better autonomous performance.

A simulation-based competition also allows for creating tasks and scoring that encourage robust, repeatable performance rather than a single, maximum scoring run.  This is done by scoring over multiple trials where the environmental conditions (e.g., sea state, wind magnitude and direction, lighting, etc.) are varied between trials.  Scoring the competition in this way provides incentives to develop robust solutions with more potential for smoothly transitioning to the field deployment.
