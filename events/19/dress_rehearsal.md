# VRX 2019 Dress Rehearsal


For the VRX Dress Rehearsal, teams will submit their system so that it can be run against previously-unseen scenarios.
Teams have already been exposed to all of the tasks that will be present in the Dress Rehearsal scenarios.
A single system must be designed to solve any of the VRX 2019 tasks.

## What to expect

[The VRX task description](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vrx/wiki/documentation) document has all the details about the tasks and about the environmental envelope expected in the unseen competition scenarios.

## Preparing your system

To ensure that your system can adapt to previously-unseen scenarios, teams should test their system at least against all released sample tasks.
