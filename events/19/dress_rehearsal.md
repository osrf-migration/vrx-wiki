# Phase 2 - Dress Rehearsal


For the 2019 Phase 2 - Dress Rehearsal, teams will submit their system so that it can be run against previously-unseen scenarios.
Teams have already been exposed to all of the tasks that will be present in the Dress Rehearsal scenarios.
A single system must be designed to solve any of the VRX 2019 tasks.

## What to expect

[The VRX task description](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vrx/wiki/documentation) document has all the details about the tasks and about the environmental envelope expected in the unseen competition scenarios.

## Preparing your system

To ensure that your system can adapt to previously-unseen scenarios, teams should test their system at least against all released sample tasks.

## Submission process

We expect to receive three files from each competitor prior to this event: 

* `dockerhub_image.txt`: Contains the name of the image to be pulled from DockerHub.
* `thruster_config.yaml`: Defines the WAM-V thruster configuration.
* `sensor_config.yaml`: Defines the WAM-V sensor configuration.

See the [submission process section](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vrx/wiki/submission_process) in the wiki for instructions about how to submit these files.

## Important dates*****

| Date                          | Description                            |

| 2019, October   28            | Results published                      |

Note: We'll allocate an extra day in the schedule (October 22) for fixing any problems related with the content of the submission files (e.g.: A noncompliant sensor or thruster configuration, a typo pointing to the DockerHub image, a problem with DockerHub permissions not letting Open Robotics to download your solution image). Teams are not allowed to modify the DockerHub image after the deadline on October 21.

*** Note:** These dates are provisional.
