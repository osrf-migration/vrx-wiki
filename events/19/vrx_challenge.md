# Phase 3 - VRX Challenge #
The process and content of the Phase 3 will be very similar to the [Phase 2: Dress Rehearsal](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vrx/wiki/events/19/dress_rehearsal).

## What to expect ##

For the purposes of continued development, teams can expect that the submission process will be the same as Phase 2.  We will only introduce changes to incorporate lessons learned from Phase 2.  We plan to finalize this very soon.

The VRX Tasks will be be the same as provided in the [VRX task description document](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vrx/wiki/documentation).  Just as done in Phase 2, team performance for these tasks will be assessed by running the team software on multiple trials of each task, where each trial instantiates a specific task scenario consistent with the general task description.

As we continue to work through the evaluation from Phase 2 we will finalize this description and notify all of the teams with plenty of advance notice to prepare for the final phase.
