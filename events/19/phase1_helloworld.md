# Phase 1: Hello World!

This simple check encourages teams to start early and is a means to identify technical issues with the simulation environment. The goal of this phase is for teams to demonstrate running VRX simulation environment locally, on their own computers, and to demonstrate early prototype solutions to the VRX tasks.

## Video Deliverable

The deliverable for this stage of the VRX challenge is an online video.  The content of the video is intentionally open-ended.  We encourage you to think creatively about how you present your current status. The only requirement is that your video demonstrate that your team has been able to setup the VRX environment locally.  To take it to the next level, we suggest teams consider including more information about there status and to show off what they have been able to achieve.  Consider the submission a highlight video of your team's status.  

Videos should be limited to no more than 5 minutes in length.

## Preparing your system

 * Teams have access to the [VRX code, documentation and tutorials](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vrx) to support setting up their local development environment.
 * [The VRX task description](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vrx/wiki/documentation) document has all the details about the tasks and about the environmental envelope expected in the unseen competition scenarios.
 * For technical support, teams are encouraged to submit to the [VRX issue tracker](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vrx/issues).


## Submission process

In future phases of the challenge team's will following this [submission process](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vrx/wiki/submission_process).  In the spirit of prototyping, teams should following the same directions for their submission to this phase.

We expect to receive a single file from each competitor:
 
 * `video_link.txt`: Contains just URL to the team's online video submission


See the [submission process wiki](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vrx/wiki/submission_process) for instructions about how to submit these files.

## Prizes

While there is no official prizes for this first phase, if there are outstanding entries
