# Phase 1: Hello World

This simple check encourages teams to start early and is a means to identify technical issues with the simulation environment. The goal of this phase is for teams to demonstrate running VRX simulation environment locally, on their own computers, and to demonstrate early prototype solutions to the VRX tasks.

## Video Deliverable

The deliverable for this stage of the VRX challenge is an online video.  The content of the video is intentionally open-ended.  We encourage you to think creatively about how you present your current status. The only requirement is that your video demonstrate that your team has been able to setup the VRX environment locally.  To take it to the next level, we suggest teams consider including more information about their status and to show off what they have been able to achieve.  Consider the submission a highlight video of your team's status.  

Videos should be limited to no more than 5 minutes in length.

## Preparing your system

 * Teams have access to the [VRX code, documentation and tutorials](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vrx) to support setting up their local development environment.
 * [The VRX task description](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vrx/wiki/documentation) document has all the details about the tasks and about the environmental envelope expected in the unseen competition scenarios.
 * For technical support, teams are encouraged to submit to the [VRX issue tracker](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vrx/issues).


## Submission process

In the spirit of prototyping, we ask that teams submit the link to their video using the same process you will use to submit your solutions in future phases of the challenge. Please see the [submission process wiki](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vrx/wiki/submission_process) for detailed instructions.

We expect to receive a single file from each competitor:
 
 * `video_link.txt`: Contains only the URL to the team's online video submission


## Important dates

| Date                          | Description                            |

Note: We'll allocate an extra day in the schedule (September 24) for fixing any problems related with the content of `video_link.txt` (e.g.: A typo writing the URL of the video). Teams are not allowed to modify the video after the deadline on September 23.


## Prizes

While there is no official prizes for this first phase, if there are outstanding entries we hope to be able to recognize them appropriately.
