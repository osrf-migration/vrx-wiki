# Qualifier (Hello World!) 

This simple check encourages teams to start early and is a means to identify technical issues with the simulation environment. The goal of this phase is for teams to demonstrate that they have set up the VRX simulation environment locally, on their own computers, and to demonstrate early prototype solutions to the VRX tasks.

## What to expect


## Preparing your system

 * Teams have access to the [VRX code, documentation and tutorials](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vrx) to support setting up their local development environment.
 * [The VRX task description](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vrx/wiki/documentation) document has all the details about the tasks and about the environmental envelope expected in the unseen competition scenarios.
 * For technical support, teams are encouraged to submit to the [VRX issue tracker](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vrx/issues).
