# Preparing for RobotX Interactive Tutorials and Hackathon #

During the 2019 RobotX Interactive event participants will have the opportunity to participate in tutorials on the VRX simulation framework and a half hackathon based on the VRX simulation capabilities.  In order to successfully participate in these activities, individuals should prepare by completing the following tasks:

* **Bring a Computer** Each participant should bring their own computer that satisfies the hardware and software [System Requirements for Running VRX](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vrx/wiki/system_requirements).   Optionally, having a gamepad (e.g., Logitech F310) can make teloperation easier during development.
* **Setup VRX ** The VRX simulation should be functional on your system.  Setup instructions are available in the [System Setup Tutorials](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vrx/wiki/tutorials).  We strongly encourage setting up the system from source directly on the host as described in the [System Setup Install](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vrx/wiki/tutorials/SystemSetupInstall) tutorial.  This should be verified by successfully running one of the VRX demonstrations such as the [Sand Island Demo](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vrx/wiki/tutorials/Sand_Island_Basic)
* **Know a Little ROS**  If you are not familiar with ROS we highly recommend going through the excellent [ROS Tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials) to get familiar with ROS and, in particular, with ROS topics and services.  Participants will be expected to have command of the material in the [Beginner ROS Tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials#Beginner_Level) 1-7.
* **Read the Manuals** Each participant should be familiar with the 2019 VRX documents (VRX Technical Guile and the VRX Competition and Task Descriptions) available on the [Documentation Wiki](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vrx/wiki/documentation)
