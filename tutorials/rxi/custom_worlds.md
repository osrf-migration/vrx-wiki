# RXI Tutorial: Custom, Randomized Worlds #

Creating custom worlds will allow you to expand on the VRX simulation basics to apply the tools to your own work and to future RobotX competitions.  In this tutorial we will build an example world with an assortment of tasks that could be used in RobotX 2020.  The goal is for teams to learn how to use VRX to accelerate their development and preparation for RobotX 2020.
