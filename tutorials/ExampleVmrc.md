# VMRC Example #

This example illustrates a specific configuration similar to what some of the RobotX teams used in 2018.  It includes:

* Fixed stern thrusters and a single lateral thuster - the ['T' propulsion configuration](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vmrc/wiki/tutorials/PropulsionConfiguration)
* A standard set of onboard sensors
  * Two forward facing cameras (stereo)
  * One starboard facing camera
  * GPS
  * IMU
  * 3D LiDAR

## Simulation

Start Gazebo and spawn WAM-V with propulsion and sensor configuration.

```
roslaunch robotx_gazebo vmrc.launch 
```

## Robot Localization

Visualization (and a number of other capabilities) benefit from having a fixed local frame.  The GPS sensor provides localization in a fixed frame, but having a local "odom" frame helps us avoid having to visualize the entire globe!

We can use the [robot_localization](http://wiki.ros.org/robot_localization) package to fuse the GPS and IMU data to generate a position solution, and TF transforms, within the local odom frame, where the location of the local frame is specified by the user.  

```
roslaunch wamv_gazebo localization_example.launch
```

## Visualization

Start Rviz with example configuration file to read URDF and sensors.

```
roslaunch wamv_gazebo rviz_vmrc.launch 
```
