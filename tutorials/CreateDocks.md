# Overview

In this tutorial we will demonstrate how to create new docks with your own dimensions and shapes. 

The `robotx_gazebo` ROS package contains multiple models related with docks:

* dock_block: The basic floating building block. Basically, a dock is created by combining multiple of these blocks together.
* dock_block_2x2: A 2x2 grid of dock blocks.
* dock_block_3x3: A 3x3 grid of dock blocks.
* dock_block_4x4: A 4x4 grid of dock blocks.
* dock_2016_base: A similar dock used during the 2016 RobotX competition with an `m` shape (three bays).
* dock_2016: The complete 2016 floating dock with the three placards and symbols.
* dock_2018_base: A similar dock used during the 2018 RobotX competition with an `H` shape (two bays).
* dock_2018: The complete 2018 floating dock with the two placards and symbols.

# How to create new docks

The docks are created using [erb templates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERuby). This way, we can easily automate the creation of custom docks. Follow the next steps to create your own dock.

* Create a new directory for your dock (e.g.: `my_dock_base`):

```
#!bash

   $ mkdir -p ~/vmrc_ws/src/robotx_gazebo/models/my_dock_base && cd ~/vmrc_ws/src/robotx_gazebo/models/my_dock_base
```

* Create the `model.config` file inside the `my_dock_base` directory and edit it with your favorite editor:


```
#!bash

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <model>
      <name>my_dock_base</name>
      <version>1.0</version>
      <sdf version="1.6">model.sdf</sdf>

    </model>
```

* Next, create the `model.sdf.erb` file inside the `my_dock_base` directory and edit it with your favorite editor:

```
#!bash

    <?xml version="1.0" ?>
    <sdf version="1.6">

      <!-- Important: This file is generated. DO NOT EDIT! -->

      <model name="robotx_dock_2016_base">
    <%
    layout = [
    'X  X',
    'X  X',
    'X  X',
    'XXXXXXX',
    'XXXX',
    'XXXXXXX',
    'X  X',
    'X  X',
    'X  X',
    ]
    %>
    <%= ERB.new(File.read('dock_generator.erb'),
                      nil, '-', 'dock').result(binding) %>
      </model>
    </sdf>

```
