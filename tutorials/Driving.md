# Overview #

In this tutorial we will demonstrate how to interface with the Gazebo thrust model plugin to move the WAM-V.  

The effect of thrusters on the WAM-V is simulated by the [usv_gazebo_thrust_plugin](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vmrc/src/default/robotx_gazebo/src/usv_gazebo_thrust_plugin.cc) Gazebo model plugin.  This plugin subscribes to a the custom ROS message, [UsvDrive](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vmrc/src/default/robotx_gazebo/msg/UsvDrive.msg), defined as having two values to specify the left (port) and right (starboard) normalized thrust commands.  These commands are normalized between -1.0 to 1.0, where 1.0 is maximum forward force and 1.0 is maximum reverse force.  The mapping between the values in the UsvDrive message and the actual force applied to the model are discussed in [Theory of Operation](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vmrc/wiki/VMRCGazeboPlugins) document.
