Having contributions from the community is extremely important to continue to grow the simulation capabilities for maritime robotics.  We are particularly thankful to the important contributions from the following projects, organizations and individuals:

 * The original oceans surface model (shader, texture, etc.) came from the [uuv_simulator](https://github.com/uuvsimulator/uuv_simulator) project.
 * @JonathanWheare has helped maintain support for Kinetic/Gazebo7, added an acoustic pinger model and improved the way the simulation handles lidar and the water surface.
 * @srmainwaring found a way to synchronize the visual and physical ocean surface models for his wave simulator and graciously shared it with VRX through the [wave_sim_vrx](https://github.com/srmainwaring/wave_sim_vrx) project.
