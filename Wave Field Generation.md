Thanks to the contribution from @Rhys Mainwaring (see [PR #78](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vrx/pull-requests/78/issue-23-coordinate-the-physics-and/diff and [Issue #23](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vrx/issues/23/coordinate-the-physics-and-visualization)) the VRX environment implements a model of ocean surface waves that synchronizes the visual representation with the physical influence on models within the environment.  This page is intended to explain the implementation.
