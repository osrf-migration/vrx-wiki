# Environmental Envelope #

For the VRX challenge simulation allows us to emphasize robust performance with respect to environmental uncertainty.  We achieve this by evaluating each task repeatedly over a range of environmental conditions.  The environmental envelope quantifies the range of environmental parameters that are fair game for competition evaluation.
